# Ruby on rails guide

This simple website was made following the starting [guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) in the language's website.

To set up rails in your computer, make sure you have and updated Ruby version (mine is 2.3.3) and Rails (mine is 5.0.1).

What I needed to do this (MacOS Sierra):

`$ brew install ruby`

`$ gem install rails`

To run the server, in `blog/` folder execute

`$ bin/rails server`

Then go to your browser and open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to view the result.
